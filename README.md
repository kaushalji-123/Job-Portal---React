# Job-Portal-React

**[LIVE DEMO](https://joboardportal.netlify.app/)**

Hello there! As a passionate Front-End Developer, I've created an impressive Job Portal application utilizing ReactJS, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Firebase for efficient data management and authentication.  As a continuous learner, I'm exploring possibilities to further enhance this application. In the future, I plan to introduce a feature allowing job postings directly within the platform, eliminating the need for manual updates via Firebase.

Key Features:

Explore some Demo job listings
Filter jobs by type ,job role, location, and experience
Apply filters for a customized job search
Effortlessly apply to job listings through the platform
Responsive design for optimal user experience across devices
Technologies Used:

ReactJS: Frontend development
Tailwind CSS: Styling and UI components
Firebase: Backend, database management, and authentication

Feel free to explore the live demo and contribute ideas to enhance this Job Portal application. Your feedback and suggestions are greatly appreciated!
